## HomeFileStorage

## Note!

If you realy need some self hosted filestorage look at Nextcloud or OwnCloud. Or if you curious person as I'm - please feel free to contribute!

The main idea is to create single file executable with admin dashboard, api and cli homefilestorage. Why it's "home" file storage. Because this project will host on Raspberry pi device and work in home network. Why single file executable? It's easy to deploy and setup. Config file is easy to read toml file.
