## HomeFileStorage

### Note!

This is part of my little system for my personal usage. I DO NOT propuse super ultimate solution for home storage. It's just my infinite pet-project. This sistem write my electrysity availability log, store my books and other files, check whether and many more. For all this stuff I use RaspberryPi 4 with static IP address...  

Developer documentation and tasks will be soon.
