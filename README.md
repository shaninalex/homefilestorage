## HomeFileStorage

## Note!

It's my infinite pet-project. Here I'm not actualy developming filestorage... This is sandbox where I test different approaches in software development. And filestorage is just super complex todo app where I just solving some common tasks - access management, performance, comunications between services and so on... So here I can make some mistakes. If you realy need some self hosted filestorage look at Nextcloud or ownCloud. Or if you curious person as I'm - please feel free to contribute!
